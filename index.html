<!--Paragraphs-->
    <p>My name is Allison Mack, however, I go by Ally. I have always wanted to learn how to code. In middle school, I learned a little bit of HTML and CSS, however, I wanted to learn even more! I am excited to see how much I learn in the next few weeks in the Upenn coding class. This is my website that I have created in the class. </p>

    <p>There is a link attached called "About Me". In that page, you will find everything about me: My best friends, where I am from, and my favorite foods! Make sure to go check that site out. Also, I attached a link to Ghirardelli because who doesn't love chocolate :). </p>
