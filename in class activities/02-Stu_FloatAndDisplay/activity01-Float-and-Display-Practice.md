# W1D4 - Activity 01: Practicing Float and Display

## W1D4 - Activity 01: Practicing Float and Display

* In this activity, you will practice the first few fundamentals of positioning by building three basic page layouts.

* **Files:**

    * [Unsolved Floats Folder](./Activities/02-Stu_FloatAndDisplay/1_floats/unsolved)
    * [Unsolved Block/Inline Floder](./Activities/02-Stu_FloatAndDisplay/2_block_and_inline_elements/unsolved)
    * [Unsolved Inline-Block Folder](./Activities/02-Stu_FloatAndDisplay/3_inline_block_elements)

* **Instructions:**

    * Open up the `index.html` files provided.

    * In the first file, use floats to make it so that the text wraps around both of the images. The first image should have text wrapping around it to the right whilst the second image has text wrapping around it to the left.

    * In the second file, make it so the parent element is located at the center of the page whilst all other elements inside of it are located at the center of the parent element.

    * In the third file, you will be attempting to replicate a basic layout using both floats, display, height, width, and/or the box model. The layout they will be replicating is located as an image within the [Unsolved Inline-Block Folder](./Activities/02-Stu_FloatAndDisplay/3_inline_block_elements)
